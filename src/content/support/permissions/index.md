---

First of all, it is great that you are aware of permissions you grant to other applications. Doing so helps keep your account secure.

We would like to be transparent on how we use the requested permissions to provide you the best experience at Stereo. You can also [check out our source code](https://github.com/hoangvvo/stereo-web) too.

As a reminder, our [Privacy Policy](/privacy) enables you to delete your information at any time. You can also withdraw the following permissions using the account settings page from Google, Spotify, and Apple Music.

## Google/YouTube

#### Associate you with your personal info on Google

This allows us to remember your Google account for use in authentication into the app.

#### See your personal info, including any personal info you've made publicly available

This allows us to retrieve your *name* and *profile picture*. **No** other information (even public ones) is collected.

#### View your email address

This allows us to send you emails on invites to room or updates from followed people. You can opt-out from this at any time.

#### View your YouTube account

This allows us to retrieve your public and private playlists. This information is only for you to manage playlist songs while using the app and is **not** stored on the server.

#### ⚠️ View and manage your assets and associated content on YouTube (Optional)

This permission may be misleading, but it allows us to add songs to and create your public and private playlists. We **never** look at, edit, or delete any other resources within your account.

You **may** deny this permission by unchecking the box on the prompted page, knowing that you will not be able to add to playlists.

## Spotify

#### View your Spotify account data

This allows us to retrieve your *name* and *profile picture*. **No** other information (even public ones) is collected. This also allows us to remember your Spotify account for use in authentication into the app.

Your email is also collected for us to send you emails on invites to room or updates from followed people. You can opt-out from this at any time.

#### View your activity on Spotify

This allows us to retrieve your playlists and play songs using Spotify API.

#### ⚠️ Take actions in Spotify on your behalf

This allows us to add songs to and create your public and private playlists. This information is only for you to manage playlist songs while using the app and is **not** stored on the server. This also allows us to control your Spotify playback while you use the app.
