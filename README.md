> Music is always better when we listen together

Auralous is a free project that lets you play & listen to music in sync with friends in public or private stories.

Auralous currently supports streaming music on [YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/) and [Spotify](https://www.spotify.com/). We hope to add support for [Apple Music](https://www.apple.com/apple-music/) soon.

## Structure

| Codebase         |                  Description                  |
| :--------------- | :-------------------------------------------: |
| [web](web)       |               Next.js frontend                |
| [app](app)       |               React Native App                |
| [ui](ui)         |           Shared components, styles           |
| [api](api)       | GraphQL API / URQL code, hooks, and exchanges |
| [player](player) |      The Player class and React Context       |

### Workflows

The repository is **NOT** a workspace despite its look. We use a custom setup that copied file from shared module into each "app". For example, code from `ui/src` will be copied to `app/src/@auralous/ui` on changes.

`package.json` contains the several scripts in the workspace root.

#### `yarn dev-setup`

This script must be run and kept in the background to continously copy shared files into apps.

#### `yarn lint`

Run `yarn lint` to check for errors in source code using [`eslint`](https://github.com/eslint/eslint) and apply formatting with [prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier). You can also run `yarn lint --fix` to let `eslint` fixed the errors automatically.
